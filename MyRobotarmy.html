    <h1> The first steps   
</h1>
<p> So lets begin, the first steps in designing your own AI or any computantional program is to 
    accept the obvious and scary fact. <strong>Your data isn't secure.</strong>No matter your great your <font color="ff0000"> <strong> HAXOR

skills. There will always be a faster coder, someone who will crack your locks and expose your works. Even if you are at the apex of your field, unriviled by those around you. There will always be a scraper who can uproot you purely by going to <strong>EXTREME</strong> means. </p>
<p>So, Jack, what does this mean? to break it down to simply, the future and present of data protection is indivudually designed AI. Noone can protect you but yourself, AI is an everylearning expression of individuality.<font color="FFFF00"> <strong>(It's you but better)
</strong></font>
It may seem like an intagible feat, to create a virtual person. But if you've ever typed a paragragh on a webpage then the chances are that your data has already been used in a form of AI programming without your knowledge.

</h2>
<p>What you need to build an AI might be simpler than you think. For constructing your first AI you first need to have a basic understanding of the internet. HTML, any type of scripting language and no restraints on the personal data you allow an AI to pull.
    You need to make your program as simple as possible to start. Text absorbtion is great, it takes very little time to archive text and the data vs storage ratio is the most cost effective option.
This is your starting point, if you need inspiration for a text archive thenn look no further than the (arguably) start of the internet <a Href="https://wikipedia.org"> Wiki </a> 
</p>
<P>Wikipedia is the spiders nest of the internet, its the web center if you will. From googles spider bot to the user made bots, Wikipedia is a crawlers paradise.

<h3 font color="ff0000"> MY PERSONAL ARMY</h3>
<p> I personally have created a range of bots that can do everything from webscraping to api programming. All i started with was a goal, pure automation, at the time of writing this, what once was a beautiful programmers haven has become a needless complex profit program, spit upon by its own creator. That's not to
    say all of the internt is bad. There is alway good with bad and vice versa, you just need to know where to look.
