     <h2 id="HB"> Extra Virgin Olive Oil</h2>
<p id="BodyP">
 You can't go far through your supermarket without finding a whole sectioned filled with artisanal olive oil
however, what most companies fail to disclose is that your olive oil is mostly made up of different of different oils and even different olives. Your nice $30 bottle of oil is chock-full of 
artificial properties. This is where Gardner Family Farms seeks to shatter the status qou. Our hand picked olives are made from the same batch, same species all without artificial additives.
